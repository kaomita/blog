# Intro Page

Born after 2000, I’m a Computer Science major with dreams of developing integrated control systems for smart homes. 😎

I enjoy cycling, running, watching anime, and learning about computer technology, and I occasionally write as well. 😊

The creation of this blog was a spur-of-the-moment decision, inspired by what I stumbled upon while watching videos. 😸 But I plan to keep documenting my thoughts and experiences. 😋

If you're interested in me or the content of my blog, feel free to [email me](mailto:yxiao33101@outlook.com) or [add me on WeChat](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rfh45d_sdvSjP9l3yC5IJiqxD4ceZg0m/view). Looking forward to making new friends! 🤗
